    <title>Simple html Test Site</title>
</head>

<body>
I have done several tutorials. This website is html only, and it is a practice site for the things I have learned.

</body>

<body><h1>This High lighted Text uses Tag h-1</h1>

<article>
    <h2>Smaller h-2 highlight within an article</h2>
    <p>This is a paragraph marked with the tag p within in brackets.</p>
</article>

<article>
    <h2>Again I used the h-2 tag to highlight this sentence</h2>
    <p>This is again an article tag.</p>
</article>

<article>
    <h2>Three is just for reputition and practice</h2>
    <p>I am slowly understanding the syntax and format of HTML, in particular I really like Visual Code IDE.</p>
</article>


I am using this site <a href="https://www.w3schools.com" target="_blank">Visit W3Schools.com!</a> as a helpful tool, as I do forget the tag name and function.
But Practice makes perfect I heard.


<p>The hyerlink was added using the tag a in angle brackets. <br>And this sentence was a p for paragraph.
Adding  b using /(to end the mark) and angle brackets does <b>THIS</b> which is for me as a greenhorn quit exciting.
B=BOLD
</p>

<article>
    <h2>To use this HTML doc on the internet</h2>
    <p>it needs a Defination and a usage defined, It needs a declaration. 
        I already learned this is a previous tutorial and have added it to the beginning of this document/ website. 
        <p>This will tell a browser how and what to display.</p>
    <p>Its called DOCTYPE.</p>
<p>Adding  angle brackets with html will tell the browser what it needs to render.</p>
<p>Further more a body and head are needed. The Head tags will contain information about the wesite, and things like CSS and JAVA.</p>
<p>Body tag will contain everything within the website. Thus all that is now displayed for the internet, is between the body tag as well as the html tag.</p>
<p>This text is just to highlight what I have learned sofar. 
    It is also being used for practice. You could say, I am testing my self on how much I retained <b>and</b> for practice.</p>
<p>within the head I have also declared a meta data set, the UTF. This is a universell "translator" so it can be used by computers.</p>
<p>Another Meta Tag I used was viewport, so the text can be properly responded to and displaysed on all devices. 
    <br><br>This includes tablets,mobiles and screens. 
    <br>I set it to width=device - width, intial scale(scale referrs to zooming) = 1(this values tells it not to zoom in or out).</p>
<p>This will let the site resizes itself to what ever device is viewing it.</p>

<article>
    <h2>What else I have learned</h2>
    <br> <u>This is again an article tag.</u><br> <br> <br> 

    <b>Lorem Ipsum</b> is <strong>dummy text</strong> of the printing and typesetting industry. 
    <br> <br> <br> <em>Lorem Ipsum</em> has been the industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, 
    when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book. 
    <br>It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into electronic typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged.

    <hr>
    In this section I went from using the paragraph tag to using a break line, also known as void tags, br in angle brackets. 
    <br>As I am not yet familiar with CSS, even though I did use them in a practice site during a tutorial. 
    <br>I will not include them for this simple html site.I will use styl tags throught this text, to highlight what I have learned.
<br> Throughout the text I used italic, strong, em, bold,Horizontal line,and link reference tag with a target atribute
 (but that demonstration was further above this section).<br><br>I have also demonstrate adding imag src once from a placeholder online iamge website,<br>
 and one from my local folder. I also added a border to the local image.
<br>
UL and OL listing and its differnt types are also included in the demonstration.
I obviosouly added tabels with some formating.
<br>
To be fair, I do need to practice, otherwise I will probaly forget. Or I use this index html site as a cheat sheet.
<br>
<article>
    <h2>This was quit fun</h2>
    <p>The website is not pretty, indeed it is not. But it was not indended for that just yet.
        <br>
    I am using it to practive, and it will be used to learn how to publish it online as well.
    Not that its pretty enough for that, but it helps for when I get CSS and Typescript going, and want to upload the end product.
